\section{The Man Comes Around}
And I heard as it were, the noise of thunder.  One of the four beasts saying: come and see!
 
And I saw! 
 
And behold, a white horse.
 
\chapter{Chapter 1: The Hard Worker}
There was a man who was renowned for both his hard work and his passion for what he did.  

He grew up in Central America, his father working as a Civil Engineer; building dams, bridges, and following the work created by the industrialization of the South Americas.  From evading bus robbers in the rural parts of Columbia to learning a new language in a foreign country, to dropping water balloons on cars from the window of his family's apartment, his childhood was filled with happy memories which grew him into a man who loved pursuing challenges and solving problems.

His name was Ethan, and he graduated high school in Boston, then attended college on a scholarship from the Air Force, later dropping out of the Air Force Academy.

Graduating from Cal Tech with a degree in Electrical Engineering, he created a company which was similar to Yelp, but long before Yelp, or even the internet was considered part of life in the average household.  

The site allowed small restaurants to make themselves more discoverable on a public domain, which offered a revolutionary new market.  Unfortunately, the company was, in many ways, ahead of its time, and no restauraunt owners saw need or demand for a means of marketing themselves on a niche technology. 

After roughly two million dollars of investment into the start-up between six people, the company went under and was declared bankrupt.  Several months of toil, anxiety, meetings with investors, and personal savings were poured out, with nothing to show for.

However, lessons were learned, the six friends parted ways on good terms, and Ethan re-entered the workforce, working towards a Ph.D at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and taking a job as a lecturer at HKUst.

From the failed start-up, he learned how to allocate and assign resources more efficiently, decided to hire based solely on merit, and in his work, kept his eyes open for the next technology that the world was in need of.


\chapter{Chapter 2: A Chip For Your Thoughts}

During his work at UMich,  Ethan began to explore the field of EE circuitry and, with two colleagues he met in a research lab, began prospecting the idea of chip design startup which emphasized on graphics chips and MoCA semiconductors.  After taking several loans to invest in design equipment and a contract with a Japanese chip-making company to produce prototypes, the company began gathering investors and finally picked up its first customers.  Small companies, like Sentinel, MLink, Dell, and then big names; Boeing, Panasonic, Broadcom.

A tight employee ethic of hard work and commitment to success began to pay off, as Ethan's team grew closer and closer, and their products began to earn their way into the top names of the field.  As the years continued, Ethan eventually was able to move out of his apartment and into a house in central San Diego.  His parents immigrated the the United States nearing their retirement, and two nephews and nieces joined his family. 

R&D kept their products a few years ahead of their competition, despite the "lag time" of production to shipment, and Ethan eventually became the primary technical officer of the company in the same month as he earned his Ph.D.  After several unexpected roadblocks, including the sudden passing of one of their core employees, several frivolous lawsuits by competitors, and the housing market crash, their mission and passion for their work kept the team going.  

This time around, his work paid off, and the lessons learned from his past failure paid off. 

In 2010, Ethan and his original team of six engineers, businessmen, technicians, and researchers brought their company to IPO. 


\chapter{Chapter 3: Ecclesiastes}

The following June, four weeks after IPO and three days after the IPO party, the man sat at his home, and looked over his life.  32 years of hard work, love from his parents, frienship with his collegemates, and pursuit of his passion had paid off.  Looking ahead, he considered the accquiring of two small companies in the LA area, the soon and much-needed renovation of his house, and the upcoming family reunion in Northern California.  

In addition to the promising development of his company, his wise investments from several years' earlier in small, unheard-of companies like Uber and Bitcoin had paid off, with dividends.  

The man thought to himself, ‘What shall I do, for I have much more than I need to support my lifestyle?’ And he said, ‘I will do this: I will sell all my stocks and invest in new companies; I will buy some small properties and develop them to resell or rent out; this is how I will use and store up my goods.  And I will say to my soul, “Soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years; you live frugally, and you have a secure career doing what you love!.  Relax, eat, drink, be merry.”’ 


But God said to him, ‘Fool! This night your soul is required of you, and the things you have prepared, whose will they be?’ 

So is the one who lays up treasure for himself and does not consider the most important questions of life.
